MenuUI README
=============

Flexible menu driven user interface for Arduino.

MenuUI allows to write rich menu-driven user interfaces for Arduino boards with
attached LCD, with unlimited sub-menu depth, display of values, editing of
numerical parameters and easy navigation with a set of three buttons or a
rotary encoder. 

Based around simple concepts, MenuUI uses two lines of text, one generally for
the current menu title and the other for Sub-Menus, Options or Values. Sub-Menus
are menu entries that it turn have other menus. Values display a piece of 
information to the user, possibly in real time, like the uptime. Options are
user-editable settings.

MenuUI recognizes and uses 4 different user inputs: prev, next, click and
click-and-hold. Three buttons or a rotary encoder with a button (recommended)
are enough to provide all input needed for the operation of the menu driven
interface.
